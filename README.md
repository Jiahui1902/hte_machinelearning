# hte_machinelearning
This repository keeps the codes used in estimating heterogeneous treatment effects using machine learning approaches in Brand et al., 2020.

This repository includes the following R scripts: 
- 0_setup.R: set up the working environment and load necessary packages
- 1_CausalTree_Functions.R: define functions to estimate the heterogeneous treatment effects, adjust the estimates, and visualize the results
- 2_run_grf.R: use generalized random forest (grf) to estimate the heterogeneous treatment effects
- 3_RunResults.R: run main results incorporated in Brand et al., 2020
